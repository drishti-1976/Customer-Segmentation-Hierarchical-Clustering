## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this project is to segment mall customers into meaningful groups using **unsupervised machine learning techniques**, primarily **Hierarchical Clustering**, to help businesses understand customer behavior and design better marketing strategies.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Name:** Mall_Customers.csv  
- **Features:**
  - CustomerID
  - Gender
  - Age
  - Annual Income (k$)
  - Spending Score (1–100)

This is an **unsupervised learning problem**, so no target variable is used.
